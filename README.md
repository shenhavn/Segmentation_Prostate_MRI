# Segmentation_Prostate_MRI
This project includes implementation of Unet-based segmentation algorithm for prostate MR images.
Our goal is to achieve high-score prostate segmentation using the U-Net model,
despite the challenges posed by variations in data from multiple centers, vendors and protocol,
as encountered in our selected dataset.
